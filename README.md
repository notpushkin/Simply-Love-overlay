# Ale's overlay for Simply Love

Usage: unpack files from this repo over your Simply Love installation (probably `~/.stepmania-5.1/Themes/Simply Love`, if you're on Linux). This adds the following modifications:

- Difficulty change sounds are taken from the default StepMania theme, as those are louder and easier to notice when the track preview is playing (so you don't accidentally change difficulty)
- Some background music is added to the Evaluation screen
  - May be better suited for public machines where evaluation screen won't usually stay up for long
  - Currently uses evaluation music extracted from J*** D**** (please don't sue me)
  - TODO: find out a way to start given file from a random position (right now we use 3 different files with the same loop starting at different position)
